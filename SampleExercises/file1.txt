Crusoe is the novel's narrator.
He describes how, as a headstrong young man, he ignored his family’s advice and left his comfortable middle-class home in England to go to sea.
His first experience on a ship nearly kills him, but he perseveres, and a voyage to Guinea “made me both a Sailor and a Merchant,” Crusoe explains.
Now several hundred pounds richer, he sails again for Africa but is captured by pirates and sold into slavery.
He escapes and ends up in Brazil, where he acquires a plantation and prospers.
Ambitious for more wealth, Crusoe makes a deal with merchants and other plantation owners to sail to Guinea, buy slaves, and return with them to Brazil.
But he encounters a storm in the Caribbean, and his ship is nearly destroyed. Crusoe is the only survivor, washed up onto a desolate shore.
He salvages what he can from the wreck and establishes a life on the island that consists of spiritual reflection and practical measures to survive.
He carefully documents in a journal everything he does and experiences.
After many years, Crusoe discovers a human footprint, and he eventually encounters a group of native peoples—the “Savages,” as he calls them—who bring captives to the island so as to kill and eat them.
